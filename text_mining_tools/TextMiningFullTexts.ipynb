      "abstract Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.High-throughput computational screening has emerged as a critical component of materials discovery. Direct density functional theory (DFT) simulation of inorganic materials and molecular transition metal complexes is often used to describe subtle trends in inorganic bonding and spin-state ordering, but these calculations are computationally costly and properties are sensitive to the exchange-correlation functional employed. To begin to overcome these challenges, we trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict quantum-mechanically-derived properties, including spin-state ordering, sensitivity to Hartree-Fock exchange, and spin-state specific bond lengths in transition metal complexes. Our ANN is trained on a small set of inorganic-chemistry-appropriate empirical inputs that are both maximally transferable and do not require precise three-dimensional structural information for prediction. Using these descriptors, our ANN predicts spin-state splittings of single-site transition metal complexes (i.e., Cr-Ni) at arbitrary amounts of Hartree-Fock exchange to within 3 kcal mol-1 accuracy of DFT calculations. Our exchange-sensitivity ANN enables improved predictions on a diverse test set of experimentally-characterized transition metal complexes by extrapolation from semi-local DFT to hybrid DFT. The ANN also outperforms other machine learning models (i.e., support vector regression and kernel ridge regression), demonstrating particularly improved performance in transferability, as measured by prediction errors on the diverse test set. We establish the value of new uncertainty quantification tools to estimate ANN prediction uncertainty in computational chemistry, and we provide additional heuristics for identification of when a compound of interest is likely to be poorly predicted by the ANN. The ANNs developed in this work provide a strategy for screening transition metal complexes both with direct ANN prediction and with improved structure generation for validation with first principles simulation.\n"

lengths, selected by trial and error).', 'The parameter with the lowest average prediction error is used to select the best regularization parameter: 5 Ã 10â4 for spin state splitting, 10â2 for HF exchange sensitivity, and 10â3 for bond lengths.', 'We varied and optimized the learning rate between 0.05 and 1.5, and optimal rates were selected as 1.0 (bond lengths) and 1.5 (spin state splitting or HF exchange sensitivity).', 'We obtain Ï values of 0.6 for spin state splitting, 0.07 for HF exchange sensitivity, and 10000 for bond lengths (see Section 3).', 'Exchange sensitivity provides value both for extrapolation of computed (see Section 3.6) or literature values obtained at an arbitrary exchange mixing and in identification of cases of high sensitivity to DFT functional choice.3.4 Predicting equilibrium geometries with an ANNUsing our descriptor set, we trained an ANN on the minimum metal ligand bond distances for both low spin and high spin geometries (min(RLS/HS)), which only differ from the exact metal ligand bond length for distorted or heteroleptic compounds.', 'This ANN for bond length prediction extends capabilities we have recently introduced for generating high quality transition metal complex geometries in order to enable spin state dependent predictions without requiring extended geometry optimization.', 'Thus, if the ANN bond length predictions are accurate, adiabatic spin state splittings can be obtained from DFT single points at ANN predicted HS only or both LS/HS geometries.Metal ligand bond distances in the aHF = 0.20 data set vary from min(RLS) = 1.81 Ã (in Fe(II)(pisc)2(Clâ)4) to min(RHS) = 2.55 Ã (in Fe(III)(Clâ)6).', 'The metal ligand bond length ANN produces comparable RMSE across training (0.02 Ã for LS and HS) and test (0.02 Ã for LS and 0.03 Ã for HS) data with comparable errors regardless of metal identity and oxidation  or spin state (ESI Tables S27 S29 and Fig.', 'ANN bond length std.', 'of ANN predicted bond lengths, respectively (ESI Fig.', 'S17 and S23).The ANN bond lengths fall outside of computed values for low spin Fe(III) complexes by more than a full standard deviation in seven cases, e.g., underestimating Fe C distances in CN (7 5, 13 5) and pisc (3 7, 3 13) complexes ().', 'Non additive bond length effects motivate the use of the ANN in initial geometry construction.', 'Indeed, when we use ANN predicted metal ligand bond lengths in structure generation instead of our previous strategy based on a discrete database of DFT bond lengths, we reduce the metal ligand component of the gradient by 54 90% (ESI Text S4, Fig.', 'The ANN predicted bond lengths and spin states are now available in molSimplify as an improved tool for structure generation.3.5 Expanding the test set with experimental transition metal complexesIn order to test the broad applicability of the trained ANNs, we selected 35 homoleptic and heteroleptic octahedral complexes from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) with a range of metals (Cr to Ni) and direct ligand atom types (N, C, O, S, Cl) (ESI Table S30).', 'We have implemented the Euclidean norm metric alongside the ANN in our automated screening code to detect complexes that are poorly represented in training data and advise retraining or direct calculation.ANN predicted equilibrium metal ligand bond lengths for both HS and LS CSD geometries produced RMSEs of 0.10 and 0.07 Ã, respectively (ESI Tables S32 and S33).', 'Trends in bond length prediction error differ from those obtained for spin state splitting.', 'For instance, bond length errors are average in the cyclams even though spin state splitting predictions were poor.', 'The highest HS prediction errors (>0.2 Ã) occur for tests 8 and 35, underestimating the Fe N bond length by 0.2 Ã (2.1 Ã ANN vs. 2.3 Ã calculated) in the former case.', 'Interligand effects that are ignored by our descriptor set can restrict bond length extension, e.g.', \"If the experimentally measured bond distance lies close to one spin state's predicted bond length, then the complex may be expected to be in that spin state, assuming (i) the ANN provides a good prediction of the spin state specific bond lengths and (ii) that the gas phase optimized DFT and CSD bond distances are comparable.\", 'The majority of experimental bond lengths are near the extrema of the ANN predictions (subset with a calculated DFT LS HS bond distance of at least 0.05 Ã shown in  to improve readability, full set in ESI Fig.', 'Nine of the twelve (9 of 9 in ) experimental bond lengths that are on or above the predicted HS bond distance boundary have an HS ground state, eleven of the fifteen (6 of 6 in ) experimental bond lengths that are on or below the predicted LS bond distance have an LS ground state, and remaining structures (3 in ) reside at intermediate distances.', 'This bond length based spin assignment thus provides a strategy for corroboration of direct spin state prediction.3.6 Extrapolating pure exchange correlation functionals to hybrids with an ANNLinear spin state HF exchange sensitivity may be exploited to predict properties at one aHF value from computed properties obtained at another, e.g., to translate literature values or to accelerate periodic, plane wave calculations where incorporation of HF exchange increases computational cost.', 'Although this approach does eliminate the largest outliers and improve prediction across the CSD test set, it necessitates semi local DFT geometry optimizations or a judicious bond length choice for vertically approximated spin state ordering.', 'Although we have trained ANNs to predict bond lengths and spin state splitting, the data set and descriptors could be used to predict other quantities such as ionization potential, redox potential, or molecular orbital energies.']\n",

      "Metalâoxo moieties are important catalytic intermediates in the selective partial oxidation of hydrocarbons and in water splitting. Stable metalâoxo species have reactive properties that vary depending on the spin state of the metal, complicating the development of structureâproperty relationships. To overcome these challenges, we train machine-learning (ML) models capable of predicting metalâoxo formation energies across a range of first-row metals, oxidation states, and spin states. Using connectivity-only features tailored for inorganic chemistry as inputs to kernel ridge regression or artificial neural network (ANN) ML models, we achieve good mean absolute errors (4â5 kcal/mol) on set-aside test data across a range of ligand orientations. Analysis of feature importance for oxo formation energy prediction reveals the dominance of nonlocal, electronic ligand properties in contrast to other transition metal complex properties (e.g., spin-state or ionization potential). We enumerate the theoretical catalyst space with an ANN, revealing expected trends in oxo formation energetics, such as destabilization of the metalâoxo species with increasing d-filling, as well as exceptions, such as weak correlations with indicators of oxidative stability of the metal in the resting state or unexpected spin-state dependence in reactivity. We carry out uncertainty-aware evolutionary optimization using the ANN to explore a >37â¯000 candidate catalyst space. New metal and oxidation state combinations are uncovered and validated with density functional theory (DFT), including counterintuitive oxo formation energies for oxidatively stable complexes. This approach doubles the density of confirmed DFT leads in originally sparsely populated regions of property space, highlighting the potential of ML-model-driven discovery to uncover catalyst design rules and exceptions.\n"
