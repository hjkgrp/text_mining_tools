These are locally changed files from the article_downloader from the Olivetti group. 
They are adjusted for python3, and tweaked for more limited queries (relevant for 
Kulik group's purposes on limiting journals).Replace these where ever your 
articledownloader install is. If you do not replace these files, you should get the
following issues:

"cannot find scrapers.py"
and 
"HTML import" should fail.
