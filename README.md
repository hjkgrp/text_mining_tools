# text_mining_tools
Tools to facilitate mining the scientific literature.

These tools contain two major classes:
1. A Query class, which collects a list of DOIs from queries made, which can be limited to specific journals.
2. An Article class, which allows operations to be performed on a given doi (from downloading to manipulations).

Currently, Wiley, ACS, RSC, Nature, and Science publications are supported by default.
